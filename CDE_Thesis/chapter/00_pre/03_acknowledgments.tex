%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


\begin{acknowledgements}
 	I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Prof.~Francois Septier
 and Prof.~Dirk Tiede, for their constant help and encouragement. From the start
 of the project to the end, your guidance, mentoring, and support cleared the way
 for me to successfully complete this dissertation. The computational requirements
 for this research were partially covered by the Google Cloud Credits Research Grant Program. Besides,
 the Radiant Earth Foundation provides us with a space to store the dataset. This work
 was also partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation
 (project PID2019-109026RB-I00, ERDF), the Austrian Space Applications Programme
 within the SemantiX project (\#878939, ASAP 16), and the Linux Foundation Grant
 projects (project 21-ISC-1-1). The following R and Python packages
 were used in the course of this investigation and I would like to acknowledge
 their developers: rgee (\cite{Aybar2020}), sf (\cite{Pebesma2018}),
 raster (\cite{hijmans2015package}), stars (\cite{pebesma2020stars}),
 numpy (\cite{harris2020array}), lubridate (\cite{grolemund2011dates}),
 reticulate (\cite{ushey2020reticulate}), dplyr (\cite{wickham2014dplyr}),
 tmap (\cite{tennekes2018tmap}), magick(\cite{ooms2020magick}),
 rgeos (\cite{bivand2017package}) and ggplot2(\cite{wickham2011ggplot2}). Finally,
 I would like to thank B.S. Joselyn Inga and Wendy Espinoza for their work
 reporting manual labeling errors in the quality control phase of the dataset.
